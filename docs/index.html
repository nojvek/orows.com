      <p>Most great things are usually built by organized teams.</p>
      <p>ORows empowers teams to organize data and collaborate on it, with an excel/spreadsheet like interface.</p>
      <p>Easily define your data schema and set complex nested relationships using the intuitive visual editor.</p>
      <p>Add fields such as images, files, rich text, multiselect e.t.c.</p>
      <p>Set validations, calculated fields, and custom formatting.</p>
      <p>Create views to filter, sort, group and transform your data to share it as a chart or report.</p>
      <p>Granular permissions not only at row level but field level too. You can share parts of data with others for editing or have it view-only with ability for commenting and accepting suggestions.</p>
      <p>Version history is automatically saved. If you make a mistake, or someone accidentally adds bad data, you can always audit and fix it.</p>
      <p>Import/export from excel, csv, json or simply just copy-paste. You could even expose views as a REST API and receive callbacks when something changes.</p>
      <p>Build a serverless website or app with ORows as your database and management portal. Get from idea to execution within minutes.</p>
      <p>Your team can work offline and automatically sync when they're connected. Your data is always with you.</p>
      <p>ORows are spreadsheets re-invented for the 21st Century.</p>
