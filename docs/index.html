    <div class="about-me">
      <p>ORows enables teams to curate organized knowledge-bases. It's built over the spreadsheet interface that most people are familar but goes a step further.</p>
      <p>Most great things humanity has built is because an organized group of people worked together on a problem much larger than themselves.</p>
      <p>You can easily define data schemas which can be nested and have relationships.</p>
      <p>You can add rich fields such as images, files, rich text, multiselect e.t.c. You can set validations and calculated fields.</p>
      <p>You can share only parts of data with other users, or have it view-only with comments and accept suggestions. You can even set deeply granular permissions at a row and field level. '(O_o) rows!'</p>
      <p>If you make a mistake, or someone adds bad data, you can always audit and fix it. Version history is automatically saved.</p>
      <p>You can create views to sort, filter, group and transform your data to share it with someone as a dashboard, report or a form.</p>
      <p>You could even expose it as a REST API backend for your website or app. You can build a serverless website with ORows as your admin backend.</p>
      <p>You can create management systems for projects, customers, library books, schedules, inventory, surveys e.t.c.</p>
