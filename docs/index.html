      <p>'O Rows' is an idea of an app.</p>
      <p>It allows teams to curate organized knowledge-bases rather than just spreadsheets.</p>
      <p>You can define data schemas which can be nested with relationships.</p>
      <p>You can add rich fields such as images, files, audio clips, markdown text. You can even set validations and calculated fields.</p>
      <p>You can share only parts of data with other users, or have it view-only with comments and accept suggestions. You can even set permissions at a row and field level. '(O_o) rows!'</p>
      <p>If you make a mistake, or someone adds bad data, you can always audit and fix it. Version history is automatically saved.</p>
      <p>You can customize rows to look like tiles, or tree grids, or kanban boards. You can be customize rows with custom html and css. You can even build a website out of it if you want!</p>
      <p>You can create management systems for projects, customers, library books, schedules, inventory e.t.c. If you have structured data, ORows is your tool!</p>
