      <p>ORows empowers teams to manage their data with an Excel (spreadsheet) like interface.</p>
      <p>Most great things are usually built by an organized team of people working on a common goal. At the heart, what ORows offers is simplicity, order and collaboration.</p>
      <P>Easily define your data schema and set complex nested relationships using the intuitive visual editor.</P>
      <P>Add fields such as images, files, rich text, multiselect e.t.c.</P>
      <P>Granular permissions not only at row level but field level too. You can share parts of data with others for editing or have it view-only with ability for commenting and accepting suggestions.</P>
      <P>Set validations, calculated fields, and custom formatting.</P>
      <P>Create views to filter, sort, group and transform your data to share it as a chart or report.</P>
      <P>Version history is automatically saved. If you make a mistake, or someone accidentally adds bad data, you can always audit and fix it.</P>
      <P>Import/export from excel, csv, json or simply just copy-paste. You could even expose views as a REST API and receive callbacks when something changes.</P>
      <P>Building a serverless website or app with ORows as your database and management portal is easy peasy. Get from idea to execution within minutes.</P>
      <p>Your team can work offline and automatically sync when they're connected. Your data is always with you.</p>
